# Favorite Things

> An app to keep track of your favorite things.

The application is deployed at [favorite-things.name](https://favorite-things.name)

Built with:

- Python 3
- Django / Django Rest Framework
- ES2018
- Vue / Vuex
- Bulma
- PostgreSQL
- Zappa
- AWS Lambda + RDS + S3

## Design notes

- The application consists of a Django/DRF backend and a Vue SPA frontend, backed by PostgreSQL.
- Although authentication was not a requirement, it helps me properly conceptualize the application so
  I built a simple username-only "authentication" backend
- Building an auditing implementation from scratch was not a requirement, so I used an existing library to
  accomplish this, which allowed me to focus on other parts.
- As mentioned in the answers.md, enum support in the metadata field is lacking. I found this was a good tradeoff
  to make, as it allowed to avoid a whole lot of additional complexity and thus time.
- The deployment is automated as much as possible, although the DNS configuration must be done
  through the AWS GUI.

## Installation

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd assets
$ npm install
```

## Development

#### To setup pre-commit linting for Python and Javascript with Flake8 and ESLint, respectively:

```bash
cp pre-commit .git/hooks
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### Run the application locally:

```bash
# in one terminal
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python manage.py runserver
# in a second terminal
$ cd assets
$ npm run dev
```

## Deployment

#### 1-command deploy:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh
```

#### When deploying for the first time, the following commands must be ran afterwards:

```bash
$ zappa manage production create_pg_db
$ zappa manage production create_admin_user
```

**Note:** the environment variables `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_HOST` need to be set in the AWS Lambda console.
Once DNS has been setup in Route53, a custom domain may be used with `zappa certify`.
